### LO1: As a student, I plan and execute a project in my specialization at level 2 of the HBO-i framework, focusing on autonomy and complexity, while applying agile methodologies in a flexible manner.

 I want to develop an app similar to Marktplaats, focusing on two main activities: advising and realizing for user interaction and software realization and design. At level 2, this means taking responsibility for tasks with moderate complexity, applying known methods effectively, and making informed decisions with some guidance.

 ### plan:

### Week 1: Brainstorming & Planning
  

We focus on brainstorming ideas for our project. We discuss different types of apps and agree to create a student marketplace inspired by Marktplaats. I contribute actively during the discussions by sharing examples of common problems students face when buying and selling online.

We also make important technical decisions. We suggest using Kotlin and Android Studio because they are suitable for Android development and already familiar to our team. This helps us set up the technical.

#### Evidence

### Week 2: Analysis & Concept Refinement
  
I analyze existing marketplace apps to improve and validate our idea. I look at platforms like Vinted, eBay, and StockX to better understand how they present products, handle navigation, and support user interaction.

I pay attention to features such as category filters, product image layouts, search functions, and messaging between users. This research helps us define what we want for our own app: a simple, visual interface that allows quick browsing, clear categories, and easy communication between buyer and seller.
 
 #### Evidence :
 As part of my competitor analysis, I explore the user interface and feature set of three popular apps: eBay, StockX, and Vinted. I took screenshots during this process to better understand how each app presents products and allows users to browse, filter, or communicate.

[eBay: The homepage includes many categories and promotions. It felt overwhelming and not suitable for a simple student marketplace app.](/image/IMG_7457.png)

[StockX: The product pages are clean and focused on buying or bidding, but the app does not offer a chat or messaging feature.](/image/IMG_7455.png)

[Vinted: This app has clear product images, filters by gender/type, and a messaging system. These features match well with the needs of student users.](/image/IMG_7456.png)



### Week 3: Use Case Writing

I describe how users interact with the system in a clear and structured way. This helps us understand the required features and how different types of users (buyers, sellers, and admins) use the app. I write simple use case scenarios to describe actions like posting a product, browsing listings, sending a message, and reporting a product. These use cases guide our UI design and backend development.

 #### Evidence :

 ### Week 4: Understanding User Needs
   
I focus on learning how to better understand user needs by studying different UX research techniques. Since I don’t use formal surveys or interviews, I look for alternative ways to learn more about what our users expect from a marketplace app.

I watch UX-related videos that explain how to identify user goals, pain points, and behaviors. These videos help me define features that make our app easier and more enjoyable to use.

Based on this, I concluded that student users value:
- A quick and simple product upload process
- Clear filters for things like category
- An easy way to chat with other users
- A clean design that avoids unnecessary steps

### Week 5: Persona 
I create two detailed personas to guide the app’s user experience. I define the needs, goals, and frustrations of our two main user types: a student seller and a student buyer. These personas help me visualize user journeys and make better design decisions.

These personas are based on assumptions about student behavior and inspired by apps like Vinted and StockX. Creating them helps me visualize user journeys and make better design decisions.

   ### Week 6: Wireframes
   I create basic wireframes by hand to plan the design of the core screens, including the homepage, chat screen, item page, and the selling form. These sketches help me quickly test       ر  layout ideas before designing them digitally.   
   #### Evidence 
   - [Wireframes](/image/d6bfc7af-4d3f-4bb6-92fd-4186cd5ab5b5.jpg)

   
   ### Week 7: ERD, SQL Script 
   
   I start by designing an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) that shows how the main parts of the system are connected. The ERD includes all the essential entities for a marketplace app,      including users, products, and their relationships. After completing the ERD, I write a full SQL script to match the design. This script reflects the same structure and prepares the        backend for future development.      
   #### evidence

   ### Week 8: UI template
   I design the user interface  of the app using Figma. I focus on the core pages and ensure the app is clean, fast, and clear for student users. This aligns with the needs of the personas.
   I designed the core pages of the app, including:

   - The homepage with a search bar, category filters, and product feed

   - The product detail page shows item information and seller profile

   - The form for uploading a new product with image, title, and price

   - The order screen where users choose delivery and see the final cost

      These templates are based on the needs of my two main personas: a student seller and a student buyer. I ensure the app was easy to navigate, visually clean, and focus on speed and clarity for student users. This step helps us agree on a shared design direction before starting implementation.

      ### Week 9: Implementation HomePage
      I start building the app in Android Studio using Jetpack Compose. I begin with the homepage, since it’s the first screen users see and connects everything else in the app. I follow        the design I made in Figma and focus on getting the layout right. I add tا product cards and the bottom navigation bar. I test the layout on a physical device.

      ### Week 10: Filter by Category
       I  add category filtering. When a user taps on a category, the product list updates to only show items from that category. 

      #### Evidence:
     [add category filter](https://github.com/FontysVenlo/PRJ4-2025-prj4-2025-s05/commit/17380adbfc662adadecbbca4116001944cfe0015#diff-ff270f425d0d8a160792b83aa6884a95e09e665196187497c1a33df31d98305f)
     

      ### week 11: Chat Feature 
      I build the chat screen so users can message each other about products. Instead of using a card based order button, I switch to a chat feature after testing. Chat feels more natural and better fits how students usually interact when buying and selling.

      #### Evidence:
       - [add chat feature ](https://github.com/FontysVenlo/PRJ4-2025-prj4-2025-s05/commit/64b8263ead6d8bef8e26e020542a6a7ac6511b13#diff-61ce6a8b3e8e35f7c979139f2a512eb4e309a077e1e085f79a74805d47275e48)

    
     ### Week 12: Feedback
     I  started collecting feedback from users. One of my friends tested the app and shared some helpful input. He said the plus (+) icon on the product card wasn’t clear, and he didn’t like the heart icon in the bottom navigation bar it didn’t make sense to him. He also mentioned that it would be useful to send images in chat, especially if users want to share more details about the item. He also want to see seller name.

     ### week 13: Chat Overview
        I  develope a new Chat Overview screen that shows all recent conversations. Each chat preview displays:

        - The product image 

        - The product title

        - The last message in the conversation

       This makes it easier for users to manage their chats and continue conversations quickly.

     ### LO2: As a student, I apply professional skills at level 2 in the focus areas: future-oriented organization, investigative ability, personal leadership, and targeted interaction.

     I want to apply my professional skills at level 2 of the HBO-i framework, using the sub-skills of Process Management (Future-Oriented Organisation), Research (Investigative Ability), Personal Profiling (Personal Leadership), and Collaboration (Targeted Interaction). This means contributing actively to the team, staying organized and aware of future steps, researching effectively, reflecting on my role, and communicating with others in a respectful and constructive way throughout the project.



      ### Future-Oriented Organization ( Process Management)
     
     I manage the development process in an organized way. Every Wednesday, my team and I hold structured meetings on Discord, where we reflect on last week’s tasks and plan the upcoming        ones. We use a GitHub board to track what is done, what is in progress, and what needs to be started. This consistent routine allows us to monitor progress, spot delays early, and          adjust our workflow if needed. It helps ensure that we stay aligned with our deadlines and project goals without confusion or miscommunication.

     ### Investigative Ability ( Research)
     
     Before designing any features, I research similar platforms like Vinted, StockX, and eBay to learn how they solve common problems. I explore their user interfaces and functionality to understand what works well and what doesn’t. I also watch several YouTube videos explaining UX research techniques, which help me define what student users want even without conducting full interviews. This way, I make sure that our app isn’t based on assumptions, but rather on informed decisions. The outcome of this research shaped key features such as search filters, product categories, chat functionality, and an easy upload process.

      [Week 4](https://github.com/FontysVenlo/PRJ4-2025-Ind-abdulazizbm/edit/main/PDP.md#week-4-understanding-user-needs) 
     ### Personal Leadership (Personal Profiling)

     I take responsibility within the team by sharing the initial idea for the app and showing how it solves specific problems for students. Throughout the project, I stay involved in every phase: from concept planning to UI design and coding. I take initiative during meetings, often guiding the team on what to focus on next. I also reflect on my own role and skills, and I try to improve by learning more about design, user experience, and Kotlin. This attitude helps me grow as a team member and makes my contribution more valuable over time.

     ### Targeted Interaction (Collaboration)
     Even though I live far from campus, I try my best to attend team meetings in person whenever possible. If I know I’ll miss a session, I inform both my team and coach ahead of time. I       usually talk to the coach first to give my teammates a chance to prepare their own questions or points. I also try to create a positive team atmosphere, especially when someone is          stressed or under pressure. By staying consistent, respectful, and helpful, I support the team dynamic and ensure smooth collaboration throughout the project.

     ### Reflection 

     This semester was different our group had only three people instead of the usual six, so there was more pressure on each of us. I tried to stay active and help my teammates as much as      I could.
     
     I built a chat feature for the first time and got feedback from someone outside the group, which really helped me see things I hadn’t noticed. 

     Since we worked more online than in past projects, I got better at managing my time and communicating digitally. I also became more open to feedback and learned how to react to it         without taking it personally. I did a lot of self-research too, especially in Week 2 and Week 4, and that helped us design better features.

     Next semester, I want to do a user survey earlier and improve my documentation. I’ll also keep working on my communication and research skills.
