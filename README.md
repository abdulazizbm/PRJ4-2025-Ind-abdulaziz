# Student Marketplace App

A student-focused marketplace application that allows students to buy and sell second-hand items such as books, clothes and electronics.  
The goal is to provide a simple, safe and school-only trading platform.

---

## 1. Project Context

Students often want to trade used items but do not have a dedicated platform inside their school community.  
Public platforms like Marktplaats or Vinted involve strangers, ads, and many unnecessary features.

This project provides a small and focused marketplace designed specifically for student use.

---

## 2. Problem

There is no easy way for students to safely buy and sell used items within their school environment.  
General marketplaces feel unsafe or overly complex.

---

## 3. Proposed Solution

A mobile application that enables:

- Creating product listings with images, price and description  
- Browsing and filtering items  
- Messaging between buyers and sellers  
- Logging in using student email only  

The solution focuses on simplicity, trust and a student-only system.

## 6. Current Status

This project was developed as part of a school assignment.  
It is not maintained as a production system, and some services such as the original SQL database instance used during development are no longer active.

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the structure of the backend (LoopBack + SQL), the Android Jetpack Compose frontend, and the overall development process.  
All core logic, controllers, models, and UI components are included and can be reviewed, extended, or connected to a new database if needed.

## 8. What I Learned

Through this project I learned to:

- Build a backend using LoopBack 4 with TypeScript  
- Connect a mobile application to a SQL database  
- Structure UI with Jetpack Compose using MVVM  
- Design and implement REST APIs  
- Handle authentication and user interactions  
- Implement chat functionality and image handling  
- Apply user feedback to improve the UI  
- Combine backend and frontend systems effectively  

This project strengthened my practical skills in both mobile and backend development.
