### Context 

For Project 4, we noticed that many students want to sell or buy second-hand items like clothes, books, or electronics, but they don’t have a simple and trusted way to do this inside
the school environment. Apps like Marktplaats and Vinted exist,but they are made for the general public and often include strangers, ads, or unnecessary features.

That’s why we came up with the idea to build a student-to-student marketplace app. The goal is to make something small, useful, and focused on student needs only. 
The app should let students post items, browse listings, and chat with each other inside the app.

### problem

Students often want to buy or sell used items, but they don’t have a dedicated and safe platform for doing this in a school setting. Public platforms are not made for students,
and using them can feel unsafe or too complex. Also, students may feel more comfortable trading with people from the same environment.

### Proposed Solution

Our solution is to create a basic marketplace app designed for students. It will allow users to post products with pictures, price, and description.
Other students can browse these items and filter them by categories like books or clothes. When they find something they’re interested in, 
they can message the seller directly through the app.
We will also add a login system that uses student emails to make sure only students can join. This makes the platform safer and more focused.
